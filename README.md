# videoplayar
 
Just trying to know which package makes sense to use for video rendering in another project.

Just go with Chewie...And it won't render on iOS unless you mess up with the Widget tree and re-wrap your Scaffold with a Material App. Which will block you there forever, but it will render..

Anyways... this project is just experimentation. Vamos a la Playar !
